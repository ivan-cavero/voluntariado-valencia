## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our application, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

1. **Do Not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please send an email to [security@voluntariadovalencia.com](mailto:security@voluntariadovalencia.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report".

3. In your email, please include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

4. You can expect an initial response to your email within 48 hours. We will send you regular updates about our progress.

### What to Expect

After you've submitted a vulnerability report:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and begin investigating.
2. We will keep you informed of the progress towards fixing the vulnerability and may ask for additional information or guidance.
3. Once the vulnerability is confirmed and fixed, we will notify you.
4. We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Measures

We implement several security measures to ensure the safety and integrity of our application and user data:

1. Regular security audits and penetration testing
2. Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest
3. Regular updates and patching of dependencies
4. Strict access controls and authentication mechanisms
5. Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before making any information public.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research.

We commit to not pursue legal action against researchers who point out a problem, provided they follow these guidelines.

Thank you for helping keep our project and our users safe!
